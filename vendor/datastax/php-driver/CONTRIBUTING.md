## Reporting bugs

It is inevitable that code will have bugs. There are a few things you can do to
help the maintainer to fix the bug that you've discovered quicker:

* [Use the PHP Driver Jira](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/projects/PHP) to report all issues and bugs.
* Include the version of the Driver, PHP and Cassandra or DSE in your Jira ticket.
* Include a complete stack trace of the failure as well as any available logs.
* Include any additional information you think is relevant - the description of
  your setup, any non-default Driver configuration, etc.
* Write a failing test. The PHP Driver uses [PHPUnit test framework](https://phpunit.de/). A reliably
  failing test is the fastest way to demonstrate and fix a problem.

## Pull Requests
